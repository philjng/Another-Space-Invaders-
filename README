Game introduction / buttons and legend not created yet, this README will substitute for now
Arrow keys to move, spacebar to use ability.
Will add additional / alternate abilities later

UFO - 400 points
PowerUps - 300 points
- square power up: attack speed increase (at level 3, 7, 13)
- circle power up: allows for a 3 second spread attack on space bar press and grants shield for short moment
- heart: recover a heart (every 5th level, additional heart at every 4 when health < 4)

taking damage will take 1 heart and provide a barrier that ignores all damage for 3(?) seconds
